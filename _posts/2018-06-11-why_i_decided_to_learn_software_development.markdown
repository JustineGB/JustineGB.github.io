(1) I like writing code:
About a year ago, I met a person who was just starting to learn code. She was learning it in her free time - a weekend hobby. She had no prior background in coding and did not consider herself a 'tech' person. I was so inspired by her, I thought, “If she can do, so can I! What is stopping me?” So, I went online that night and began to research more about web development, and then started a few of the free coding programs offered online.  I love to problem solve and figure out puzzles, so I quickly enjoyed writing code. Coding allows you to be logical and creative at the same time. It is never boring! After a year, I was still interested, but with limited time between work and life, I knew I had to make a change in order to pursue this passion full-time. With the blessing of my supportive boss, I started to work from home and then went about selecting the best code boot-camp option. The reviews, learning style, career support, and the Women Take Tech scholarship helped me quickly settle on the best option - Flatiron School, and I signed up and started June 5th! 

(2) Job Security and projected growth:
It gives me peace of mind to pursue a career in web development because it is a job sector that is growing at a rapid pace. While many people are adverse to change, I embrace change and look at it as growth. I am of the mindset that if you are not pushing forward, you are falling behind. I am excited to have found a career that allows for creativity and continued learning. There will always be new languages to learn and master, and I will continue to ‘push the ball forward.’ Software development is a crucial skillset now and in the future. I am excited to learn to code so that I can teach my children to code one day. I believe that coding will quickly go from being an elected skill to an essential professional skill in the near future.  

(3) Salary and Lifestyle:
I want a career that I am passionate about and one that can support the lifestyle I have worked hard to create. Web development fits the bill. I enjoy writing code, and I am excited by the fact that web development is tremendously diverse - almost every job sector needs web developers, so one can find a position in a wide range of industries depending on his/her interest.

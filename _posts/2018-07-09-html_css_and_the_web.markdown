What exactly is The Web? The Web is short for the World Wide Web which is an information system that allows documents to be shared and connected to other documents via hyperlinks. The web allows you to connect to millions of different webpages via the internet. Client computers send requests via the internet to a server computer which send the requested info back across the internet to the client computer. This is called the HTTP protocol; it is a request-response protocol. 

HTML is the language of the web. In order for your program to be readable across the web, it must utilize HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup language and it is very simple, yet extremely powerful. HTML is basically the backbone of the web â€“ it provides the crucial structure. 

While HTML is great for providing necessary structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is great for providing form and beauty to your webpage. CSS allows you to easily add color, form, formatting, etc. HTML provides the function/content of the webpage and CSS handles the presentation. It is much easier to manage your code when HTML and CSS are separated out as you can quickly edit your content without having to adjust your formatting.
